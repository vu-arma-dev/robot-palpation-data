# Robot-Palpation-Data #This repository shares the experimental robot palpation data from the collaborated project, "NRI: Large: Collaborative Research: Complementary Situational Awareness for Human-Robot Partnerships."## Get Started ##* Installing and activating Matlab* Download the code and data from [here](https://github.com/vu-arma-dev/robot-palpation-data). Extract the code in a folder, say, the path is ***path-on-machine/robot-palpation-data/**** Set the environment variable for your OS, ***NRIDATASHARE*** = ***path-on-machine/robot-palpation-data/***		* For how to ***create/set/change/remove*** a user environment variable for Windows, see this [2-min youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEroNNzqlF4).		* For how to ***create/set/change/remove*** a user environment variable for Ubuntu, see this [1-min youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6_7xaxkPik).		*  NOTE that the environment variable needs to be set before running Matlab.* Run ***Setup\_Directories\_data.m***
