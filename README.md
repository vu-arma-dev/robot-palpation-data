# Robot-Palpation-Data #This repository shares the experimental robot palpation data from the collaborated project, "NRI: Large: Collaborative Research: Complementary Situational Awareness for Human-Robot Partnerships."## Get Started ##* Installing and activating Matlab* Download the code and data from [here](https://github.com/vu-arma-dev/robot-palpation-data). Extract the code in a folder, say, the path is ***path-on-machine/robot-palpation-data/**** Set the environment variable for your OS, ***NRIDATASHARE*** = ***path-on-machine/robot-palpation-data/***		* For how to ***create/set/change/remove*** a user environment variable for Windows, see this [2-min youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEroNNzqlF4).		* For how to ***create/set/change/remove*** a user environment variable for Ubuntu, see this [1-min youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6_7xaxkPik).		*  NOTE that the environment variable needs to be set before running Matlab.* Run ***Setup\_Directories\_data.m***## Play with the Data Sets - Try the Following Test Scripts! ##### Force-controlled Exploration to Obtain the Geometry Contacts ###In this section, the robot is controlled to maintain a small interaction contact force in the normal direction of an unknown surface. The goal is to collect the surface geometry contacts while deforming the environment the least.* Run ***force\_exploration\_results.m***, the displayed result was published in [Journal of Mechanisms and Robotics](http://mechanismsrobotics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/article.aspx?articleid=2597974)* Run ***force\_exploration\_results('Hamlyn')***, the displayed result was presented in Hamlyn Robot Challenge 2017.* Run ***force\_exploration\_results('KidneyVU')***### Force-controlled Continuous Palpation ###In this section, the robot is controlled using a sinusoidal superimposed force in the surface normal direction while the motion in the tangent direction is specified by either telemanipulation or by pre-planned raster path. Using the collected data - positions and forces - one could estimate the stiffness mapping in offline or online approaches. Our works have been published in [ICRA 2016 continuous palpation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7487609/) and in [RA-L 2018 continuous palpation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8279448/).Data sets collected using this control scheme are stored in ***Data\_original\continuous\_palpitation\palpation***. ### Probing Palpation ###In this section, the robot is controlled to provide probing motion at different depths along the surface normal direction. In the probing data sets, for one probing sample, a series of positions and forces are grouped, which makes it easier to calculate the stiffness of this location.Data sets of probing data have been used in our works in [ICRA 2016 complementary model update](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7487224/), in [ICRA 2016 to guide probing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7487225/), and in [RA-L 2017 utility-guided probing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7827116/)Data sets collected using this control scheme are stored in ***Data\_original\probing***.
