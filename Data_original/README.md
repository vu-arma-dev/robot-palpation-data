# Data Collection #We store the robot experimental data under this folder. Most data sets are collected in robot palpation or robot force-controlled exploration. There is a section below describing each of the data sets.Most of the data sets contain robot positions, forces, and associated time during experiment. The robot data samples are referring to the class definition "dvrk_logger" written in Matlab.
